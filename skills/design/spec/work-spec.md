# Work the next Spec Task

`spec work <spec>` works exactly one child Task of the named Forge Spec. It is not a global task picker.

1. **Preflight summary support.** Verify that `forge summary <spec>` is available. If unavailable or unsupported, stop and report the prerequisite; do not fall back to `forge show`, `forge next`, or ad-hoc parsing.
2. **Load the parent summary.** Run `forge summary <spec> --json`. Use its structured parent, direct-child, dependency, state, resolution, and latest-explicit-comment facts. Confirm the named record is a Spec. Select only among its direct child Tasks.
3. **Choose one executable child.** Require child Tasks, respect dependencies and lifecycle state, and consider Grilling children only when explicitly requested or when no executable Task can proceed. If no child Tasks exist, explain that it is a tiny Spec and, only after explicit confirmation, suggest or create one ordinary child Task.
4. **Start in order.** Start the parent with `forge start <spec>` if needed, then start the selected child with `forge start <task>`. Resolve at most one child in the session.
5. **Delegate by kind.** Route research Tasks to `/research`, prototype Tasks to `/prototype`, review Tasks to `/review-implementation`, and ordinary Tasks to implementation work, using `/tdd` where appropriate. Do not implement directly from the parent Spec.
6. **Follow worktree mode when opted in.** For an ordinary implementation Task under a Spec whose approved plan opted into worktree-backed mode:
   - Require a concrete branch plan before changing files: task branch name, base ref, PR target, round, and any copy manifest. Use `worktree-branch-planning.md` as the branch-shape reference. If any required branch-plan facts are missing, stop and ask for the planning/round gate to provide them.
   - Confirm the task branch shape matches the retained plan: independent Tasks base/target the round integration base, linear dependencies stack on prerequisite task branches, and diamond dependencies use an explicit internal join branch as the downstream Task's single base/target.
   - Treat internal join branches as workflow metadata, not human-reviewed task PRs. Do not hide meaningful product, conflict-resolution, or integration-only changes solely on a join branch.
   - Stop before file changes or PR creation if the dependency graph is cyclic, has missing prerequisite tips, has an ambiguous base, or cannot be represented by the planned branch shapes.
   - Do not start a new round while any previous-round task PR is still open. Report the open PRs and wait for human review to merge or explicitly close/abandon each one.
   - Create the managed worktree with `forge worktree create <task> --branch <branch> --base <ref>` plus the required copy manifest options from the plan.
   - Run every implementation, check, commit, push, and PR command from inside the managed worktree. Forge owns local worktree lifecycle only; use `git` or `gh` directly for push and PR creation.
   - Before opening the immutable task PR, render the PR description from Forge record data using `worktree-pr-templates.md`: include at least the parent Spec id/title, Task id/title/body, dependencies, retained branch-plan metadata, verification performed, and relevant Forge comments or outcomes. If required record data or branch-plan facts are unavailable, stop before PR creation instead of inventing them.
   - Treat Forge worktree safety failures as hard stops. If create/info/remove reports missing, invalid, or dirty managed state, stop and report the exact recovery instruction instead of bypassing Forge.
   - After the task PR is open, remove the managed worktree with `forge worktree remove <task>`. The task branch and PR are immutable after PR creation: do not amend, force-push, or update them for feature or review changes.
   - Capture meaningful feature or review changes discovered after PR creation as later follow-up Tasks, not as edits to the immutable task branch.
7. **Verify implementation work.** Run relevant local tests/checks before completing an implementation Task. Leave full integration and release verification to their dedicated Tasks. Record the outcome with a Forge comment, then complete only the child when its deliverables are met. In worktree mode, the deliverable is the opened immutable task PR plus successful managed-worktree cleanup.

The mode may comment on or edit the parent only within the Task's agreed boundaries. It never auto-completes the parent Spec.
